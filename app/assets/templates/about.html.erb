      <%= image_tag("circle01.png", alt: "FX Chiropractic", class: "img-responsive") %> 
      <p>Remember back to your high school days when you were taking math and asked to find the function of “x” as it related to an equation. Well f(x) Chiropractic and Performance borrows its name from that and puts a twist on it. YOU are “x” and we are charged with optimizing YOUR function. There are many ways that modern life can limit or reduce our function like work and home stress, faulty posture, poor diet or even athletic endeavors resulting in pain in injury. Luckily, we are here to help by offering the highest quality, conservative, modern and reliable chiropractic care available in the Atlanta area.</p><br>
      <p>If you haven’t been to a chiropractor before, GREAT! We look forward to showing you what it should be. If you’ve been to another chiropractor or other healthcare provider, we do things a little different here. Each patient is treated as an individual because each person brings their own unique set of injuries, compensations, adaptations and imbalances. There are no long-term treatment plans; same 5 adjustments each visit like you’d get at a franchised office or sales pitches. Even our “no waiting” reception area is completely different. You probably were sitting in a chair to eat this morning, sitting in your car as you drove to work and again when you got to work. You’ll find all the tools you need to mobilize and stretch tight tissues and stabilize movement patterns. Please explore our website to find out more about our professional team and the state of the art treatments used to restore your function and optimize your performance.</p>
